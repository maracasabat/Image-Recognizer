# Image-Recognizer
The final project of the course Python for Data Science, on the Web framework - Django.

With this application, you will be able to make a prediction of the uploaded picture using the trained cifar10 and cifar100 datasets, as well as the integrated chatGPT will help you find answers to questions about neural networks from the book "Deep Learning in Python" by FRANÇOIS CHOLLET.

## General info
**Image-Recognizer** - it performs the following functions:
* **[cifar10](https://telegra.ph/Sifar10-03-28)** - Identifies images in pictures and makes predictions for them based on the 10 image classes that have been trained.
* **cifar100** - Identifies images in pictures and makes predictions for them based on the 100 image classes that have been trained.
* **chatGPT** - will help you find answers to questions about neural networks from the book "Deep Learning in Python" by FRANÇOIS CHOLLET. The author hopes that this book will be useful to you and help you start creating intelligent applications and solving problems that are important to you.


## Technologies
Project is mainly based on:
* Web framework: Django
* Frontend: HTML/CSS, Tailwind.css, Node.js
